              Welcome to my online portfolio!<br>
              Here, you will find a summary of my professional experience, as well as various projects I have completed 
              while training for a career as a software tester.              
            </p>
            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>
              I entered the field of software development in September 2020 by enrolling in a web and mobile developer training program at École Pratique in Marseille. 
              This program allowed me to learn the fundamentals of both back-end and front-end development using technologies such as Java, Spring, and React. 
            </p>
            <p>
              During my training, I completed an internship at ITSO Technologies in Avignon, where I initiated the implementation of automated tests for the user management 
              functionality of a client’s website. I set up API tests using SpringBoot and JUnit5. This experience made me realize my strong interest in software testing, which 
              became the core focus of my internship at the company’s request. I wrote my certification project report (which you can download 
              <a href="/portfolio-en/docs/project-report-Amandine-Douguedroit.pdf" download="project-report-Amandine-Douguedroit.pdf">here</a> if you wish, but please note that 
              it is written in French) on this initial implementation and automation of tests. However, my lack of emphasis on front-end development led to my failure in obtaining 
              certification. As a result, I stepped away from development for a few years.
            </p>
            <p>
              In July 2024, I embarked on a certification program in software testing through the online education platform OpenClassrooms. Midway through my training, I had 
              the pleasure of joining the team at PrettyData, a startup that develops a revenue management application for American beauty and hair salons, as a quality assurance 
              intern. The combination of OpenClassrooms training and hands-on experience in a company provided me with a solid foundation in software testing and confirmed my 
              passion for quality assurance!

              <h3>A bit more about my professional journey</h3>
              <h4>From my first passion to the start of my professional life</h4>
              <p>
                At eleven years old, a friend told me that our school offered free theater classes. We decided to participate, and I instantly fell in love 
                with acting. I wanted to make it my career. I spent years studying theater, first in a club, then in high school and conservatory. I went 
                on to study Performing Arts at the University of Artois in Arras, where I earned a bachelor’s degree. I acted in two plays with the 
                Vanguard Theater company, founded by a fellow student. My professional career began with a part-time job as an usherette at the Tandem 
                National Theater in Douai and Arras.<br><br>
                During my university years, I realized that I did not want to pursue acting as a career. I made a life change and moved to Bordeaux, 
                where I completed a fulfilling civic service at Cap Sciences, a cultural center focused on science and technology. There, I discovered 
                bouldering and became passionate about it. I started climbing regularly at Arkose and eventually applied to work as a front-desk host. 
                That year provided me with valuable professional experience, strengthening my adaptability, interpersonal skills, and responsiveness in 
                a dynamic environment.
              </p>
              <h4 id="web-dev">New Direction!</h4>
              <h5>My discovery of web development</h5>
              <p>
                I later moved to Marseille to join my partner. A new chapter in my professional life! It was 2020, the height of the COVID pandemic. 
                Lockdown had just begun. I was living with my partner, a passionate web developer, who encouraged me to explore web development. As 
                soon as the lockdown ended, I enrolled in a professional training program equivalent to an associate’s degree at École Pratique. During 
                that year, I learned:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>How to integrate into an Agile development team</li>    
                <li>How to design user interface mockups and model their flow, particularly considering accessibility, using Figma</li>
                <li>How to develop static user interfaces with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</li>
                <li>How to make interfaces dynamic with React</li>
                <li>How to set up a relational database with MySQL</li>
                <li>How to develop SQL and NoSQL data access components</li>
                <li>How to build business logic components on the server side using Java</li>
                <li>How to document the deployment of a web or mobile web application</li>
                <li>How to test program functionality using JUnit</li>
              </ul>
              <h5>Testing: A Pleasant and Unexpected Discovery</h5>
              <p>
                During my training, I interned at ITSO Technologies in Avignon, and the experience turned out to be quite surprising. My final project 
                was supposed to be based on my internship work and needed to include both front-end and back-end development. However, the company 
                instead assigned me to set up and automate unit tests for one of their client’s websites. This didn’t align with my project’s expected 
                content, but the team lead reassured me that we would find a way to integrate a front-end component. I accepted—and I don’t regret it! 
                This experience allowed me to dive into software testing, applying and deepening the concepts I had studied. I enjoyed developing these 
                tests. In this project, I:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Defined a dataset</li>
                <li>Wrote a test class using the SpringBoot framework</li>
                <li>Created automated API tests for the endpoint that handles user creation</li>
                <li>Recreated a simplified version of the user management functionality using the Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Through testing, I discovered that the application did not handle cases where a user entered only spaces in the name, surname, and email 
                fields. I presented my findings to the team and was proud to contribute to improving the product!<br><br>
                As my internship and training came to an end, I wrote my project report and presented it to the certification jury. Unfortunately, I focused 
                too much on the testing aspect and skimmed over the front-end development part. The examiners deemed my front-end skills insufficient and did 
                not grant me certification.
              </p>
              <h4>Parallel Chapter: My Career in Early Childhood Education</h4>
              <p>
                Alongside my training, I worked as a babysitter for two young brothers (ages 2 and 5) after school. I discovered a natural inclination for 
                working with children and a talent for engaging with them. After the disappointment of not obtaining my certification, I shifted my career 
                toward early childhood education. I worked as a nanny in Marseille before transitioning to a daycare center. Interested in alternative education 
                methods, especially Montessori, I applied for and obtained a position as a Montessori guide for children aged 1 to 3 years old.<br><br>
                In this role, I was responsible for the well-being and psychomotor development of 16 children, as well as leading a three-person team. I closely 
                observed each child’s progress, reported their development to parents through biannual written reports, and conducted meetings to discuss these 
                reports. This job strengthened my observation skills and attention to detail while enhancing my communication and interpersonal abilities. After 
                two years, I decided to change careers once again.
              </p>
              <h4 id="QA">Career Shift!</h4>
              <h5>My Training as a Software Tester</h5>
              <p>
                Working with children was fulfilling and educational but also personally challenging. As a highly empathetic person, witnessing children’s distress 
                had a significant emotional impact on me. The job was physically and emotionally exhausting. I wanted a career that offered a better work-life balance. 
                I recalled the satisfaction I had felt while setting up tests during my ITSO Technologies internship and decided to return to web development, this time 
                specializing in quality assurance.<br><br> 
                I enrolled in a software testing certification program (equivalent to an associate’s degree) through OpenClassrooms. I quickly developed a strong passion 
                for quality assurance and software testing! During this training, I learned:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>How to execute manual and exploratory tests</li>
                <li>How to automate E2E, functional, and API tests using Cypress</li>
                <li>How to write and update a test specification document</li>
                <li>How to execute a test campaign</li>
                <li>How to analyze and report bugs</li>
                <li>How to write and present a test campaign report</li>
                <li>How to review requirements</li>
                <li>How to design a test strategy</li>
              </ul>
              <p>I also reviewed the fundamentals of web programming (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React) and participated in an Agile website development project.</p>
              <h5>My Internship at PrettyData</h5>
              <p>
                Midway through my training, I was fortunate to secure a QA Engineer internship at PrettyData, a startup that develops a digital solution for American 
                beauty and hair salon owners to manage their revenue.
              </p>
              <p id="fun-fact">  
                <b>Did You Know? 💡</b><br> 
                According to Braden Weinstock, the founder of PrettyData: "Beauty professionals in the United States earn 20% less than the average American."
              </p>
              <p>
                At PrettyData, I helped establish and refine quality assurance processes. I drafted and presented a service-level agreement to define bug resolution 
                and validation deadlines based on issue severity. I also ensured the non-regression of features through exploratory testing, and bug reporting via 
                Linear. I wrote the first version of the test plan and automated E2E tests for the application's critical features, which were integrated into the 
                company's continuous integration processes via GitHub Actions. Above all, I thrived as a quality assurance professional and found great satisfaction 
                in helping the company achieve high-quality standards!
              </p>
              <p>
                I feel confident in my choice to pursue this career because the skills it requires align perfectly with both my natural abilities and those I’ve honed 
                through my professional experiences. They say the Devil is in the details, and lucky for me—I love hunting down every last little demon (or bug) hiding 
                in the cracks. 🕵🏻‍♀️
